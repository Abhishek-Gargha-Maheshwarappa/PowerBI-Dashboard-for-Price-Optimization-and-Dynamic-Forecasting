## **Use cases**

Nike is dealing with a weak supply chain, they are facing an unbalanced supply and demand problem. Through predictive analytics we will be predicting sales and the next customer purchase date which will help the company to better manage inventory and strategically plan their next moves.

1.  If the forecast shows an increase in sales, companies will take necessary measures to keep the inventory up in the supply chain to satisfy demand.
2.  If the forecast shows a coming dip in sales, Our Model will help to retain the customers. We will do this by analysing why churn occurs and also by targeting customers with specific promotions.
3.  We will be targeting customers by doing customer segmentation, Calculating their lifetime value(LTV) and then creating special promotions for them.
4.  We will also take out the effectiveness of our promotion campaign.
5.  We implement a dynamic price optimization model which will help to give consumer seasonal and promotional offers based on current prices, demand and inventory while still remaining profitable which is something quite difficult to achieve with a flat pricing model.
